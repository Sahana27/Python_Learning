# Python Numbers

There are 3 numeric types in Python:
* int
* float
* complex

Type of variable is assigned when a value is assigned to it.

Example :
```python
x = 1  # int 
y = 2.8 # float
z = 1j # complex
```

**type()** this method is used to find the type of the object. 
```python
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
```

### Int
* Whole number 
* Positive or negative number
* Number does not have decimal 
* Numbers of unlimited length
```python
x = 1
y = 35656222554887711
z = -3255522

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(x))
```

### Float
* Positive or negative number with decimal
* Can be a scientific number with an 'e' to indicate the power of 10.
```python
x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -35.59

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
```

### Complex
* Complex numbers are written with a 'j' as the imaginary part:
```python
x = 3+ 5j
y = 5j
z = -5j

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
```
