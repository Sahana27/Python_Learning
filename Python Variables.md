# Python Variables

### Creating Variables
Python has no command for declaring variable.
Variable is created the moment you assign value to it.
```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
```

Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, can change type after been set.
```python
x = 4
x = "Sally"
print(x)
```

### Variable Names
* Variable can have short name or more descriptive name.
* Variables are case-sensitive
* Rules for Python Variables :
  - Variable name starts with a letter or underscore character
  - Variable name cannot start with a number
  - Variable name can contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores.
  - Variable name are case-sensitive.

### Output Variables 
Python **print** is oftern used to output variables.  
To combine both variable and text, use + character
```python
x = 'awesome'
print("Python is " + x)
```
 
 Also use, **+** character to add a variable to another variable
 ```python
 x = "Python is "
 y = "awesome"
 z = x+ y
 print(z)
 ```
 
 **+** character works as a mathematical operator
 ```python
 x = 5
 y = 10
 print(x + y)
 ```
 
 **+** acts as a mathematical operator
 ```python
 x = 5
 y =10
 print(x + y)
 ```
